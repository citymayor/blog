      <description>We just proceeded with CityMayor&#39;s soft launch on the weekend of March 2nd, 2018. It&#39;s been exciting and we&#39;ve spent a lot of time polishing things and fixing bugs. Fortunately after weeks and weeks of testing, bugs are now only front end bugs and the smart contract at the foundation of this project remains solid.
If you&#39;re reading these words, it&#39;s probably because CityMayor ended up being a success or because you&#39;re an early beta user of the CityMayor world.</description>
