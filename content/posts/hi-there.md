<p><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> We just proceeded with <strong>CityMayor's soft launch</strong> on the weekend of March 2nd, 2018. It's been exciting and we've spent a lot of time polishing things and fixing bugs. Fortunately after weeks and weeks of testing, bugs are now only front end bugs and <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x4bdDe1E9fbaeF2579dD63E2AbbF0BE445ab93F10">the smart contract</a> at the foundation of this project remains solid.</p>
<p>If you're reading these words, it's probably because CityMayor ended up being a success  or because <strong>you're an early beta user</strong> of the CityMayor world.</p>
<p><strong>What is CityMayor</strong>? It's an application that mixes assets (<strong>cities</strong>) with fungible tokens (<code>CityCoins</code>). The cities can be collected and traded for different amounts of <i class="fab fa-ethereum"></i> ether while the <code>CityCoins</code> can be exchanged like any other <strong>ERC-20 Ethereum tokens</strong>. You heard it right! by holding cities you will receive tokens that you will be able to trade on any exchanges that will support it.</p>
<p>To learn more about the novel concepts around CityMayor, check the <a href="https://citymayor.co/whitepaper">whitepaper here</a>!</p>
<p>Here is our <strong>roadmap</strong> <i class="far fa-map"></i> for the upcoming future:</p>
<ul>
    <li>go through <strong>one week of beta</strong> (right now) and kill all the bugs</li>
    <li>release <strong>more cities</strong></li>
    <li><strong>official launch</strong> where new cities will see an increase in price</li>
    <li>get the <code>CityCoin</code> token accepted on <strong>trading exchanges</strong></li>
    <li>implement <strong>monuments</strong> to increase the values of CityMayor's cities</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find any bugs, make sure to tell us! We'll <strong>reward</strong> you with <code>CityCoins</code> if you send us your address :) we are reachable by <a href="mailto:hello@citymayor.co">email</a>, on <i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i> <a href="https://twitter.com/citymayorco">twitter</a>, on <i class="fab fa-facebook-square"></i> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/citymayor.co/">facebook</a>, on <i class="fab fa-discord"></i> <a href="https://discord.gg/kPmGs7y">discord</a> and on <i class="fab fa-telegram"></i> <a href="https://t.me/citymayor">telegram</a>.</p>
